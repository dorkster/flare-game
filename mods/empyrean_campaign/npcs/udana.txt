her=Greetings stranger. It's not often that we have people come here from the west.
her=I see that you're carrying a weapon. Would you be interested in helping us?
you=Go on.
her=One of our encampment's residents, Krolan, works in the nearby mines. He supplies me with various gems that I craft into jewelery.
her=Krolan has not returned in some time, and I am starting to think the worst.
her=Could you please travel to the mines and look for Krolan? I will find some way to reward you for your trouble.

her=This is terrible news. Our camp is already small, so this is a devastating loss.
you=If it's any solace, I have his key and this emerald. Mementos to remember him by.
her=The key is enough of a memento. For your invaluable help, I can at least make you a ring with this emerald.

you=Can you tell me about the nearby cave?
her=It was a mining operation. Krolan was a part of the crew.
her=Not long into their dig, they encountered ruins. Ruins unlike any of the structures in this region.
her=Amongst these ruins, the crew found an incredible glowing mineral: Mastite.
her=When the Empyrean caught wind of this discovery, they promptly took control of the operation.
you=So why is it blocked off now? Did the Empyrean strip it clean?
her=The further the excavation team dug, the more apparent it became that something was unusual about the ruins. North would become south, west would become east. They were losing workers.
her=The Empyrean shut down the operation. Instead, they made an effort to mine other nearby areas in hope of finding a more stable source of Mastite. You've already seen the futile end to that story.
you=If the Empyrean gave up on the ruins, there may still be some value in exploring it. Is there any way I can get inside?
her=It's risky, but you proven that you're able to handle yourself. And maybe if we can gain our own supply of Mastite, we'll have some leverage against the Empyrean.
her=Here. I made a copy of the key you'll need after one of the Empyrean guards dropped it. Please be careful. I'm not sure I'm ready to be exposed to any more death.
